# New_Task
' pip install django ' for installing django into machine

'django-admin startproject mysite' for creating django project

'python manage.py runserver' for running the project locally

installed pillow 'pip install pillow' for dealing with images in backend

created superuser "Admin" for handling this app

(I am unable to link to react thats why created an UI in django itself to show the backend task)
